          <p>Despite the usual standard, spring in the year 2024 has been weird. After raising the expectations of
            people who hated snow, the season
            has been surprising everyone with how late it has been dropping snow. Just as people have started in getting
            out their spring and summer
            closet, the weather then drops to negative temperatures.

          <p>Make sure you heal by sleeping as much as you can. Then start planning your summer. Take care of yourself
            first! Go find work though or
            do whatever, as long as you are enjoying yourself.
