    <h3>The site should include a popup or second page with a description of your site (200 words). This

        should include: </h3>
    <p>
        <li><strong>your name or pseudonym</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cyrus Lomibao</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>description of your concept and art direction</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>The concept was generated from me finding out about the artist Matthew Carter and the famous fonts
                    that he
                    created such as Georgia, Verdana, and Tahoma and to meet the assignment criteria I decided to find
                    fonts
                    that resemble the fonts Georgia and Verdana.</li>

                <li>My concept for this project involves the use of the three fonts I chose in showing one composition.
                    I plan
                    to make a composition that revolves around the common uses of the fonts I picked whenver it’s viewed
                    in a
                    computer screen. The following concepts/ideas that I have are as follows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>(Georgia) Theano Didot for reading online magazines/newspapers </li>

                    <li>(Tahoma) Fs Tahoma 8px which is used in the fictional OS tabs </li>

                    <li>(Verdana) Source Sans Pro for doing speed typing tests </li>
                </ul>

                <li>The concept for this composition involves the idea of someone that uses an out-dated OS while doing
                    tasks
                    such as reading magazines/newspapers and doing speed typing tests </li>

                <li>Concept might be mundane, but I though the way that I want to implement it can show the idea that I
                    have
                    being playful. </li>

                <li>I’m not entirely sure if my idea will creatively use typography, but I will be implementing CSS
                    animations
                    and other CSS properties that was explored in class. </li>
